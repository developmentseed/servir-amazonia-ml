    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), which in broad terms, is defined as the ability of a machine to simulate intelligent human behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to traditional programming, ML offers:\n",
    "1) time savings on behalf of the human programmer, \n",
    "2) time savings on behalf of a human manual interpreter,\n",
    "3) overhead involved in describing step-wise instructions for a complex task such as, for example, how to recognize natural oil seeps versus anthropogenically-derived oil splills in satellite imagery\n",
    "\n",
    "ML requires good quality data, and a lot of it, to recognize key patterns and features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Humans still have a role in this process, by way of supplying the model with data and choosing algorithms and parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several subcategories of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Supervised machine learning** involves training a model with labeled data sets that explicitly give examples of predictive features and their target attribute(s). \n",

The deepest layers of a network once trained can be capabale inferring highly abstract concepts, such as what differentiates a school from a house in satellite imagery."
