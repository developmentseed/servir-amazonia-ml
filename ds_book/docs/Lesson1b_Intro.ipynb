    "### What is TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is an open-source framework, developed by Google, that is used to build various machine learning and deep learning models. It was originally released in late 2015, with the first stable version following in 2017. It’s free and open-source, thanks to the Apache Open Source license.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of using TensorFlow is not just the development of a deep neural network, but TensorFlow is focused to reduce the complexity of implementing computations on large numerical data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was designed to work on multiple CPUs or GPUs, as well as mobile operating systems in some circumstances, and it includes wrappers in Python, C++, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does it work?\n",
    "By accepting inputs as a multi-dimensional array called Tensor, TensorFlow allows you to create dataflow graphs and structures to specify how data travels through a graph. It lets you to create a flowchart of operations that may be done on these inputs, which travel in one direction and out the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tensorflow’s Structure\n",
    "Preprocessing the data, building the model, and finally training and estimating the model are the three elements of the Tensorflow structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow gets its name from the fact that it takes input in the form of a multi-dimensional array, commonly known as tensors. You can create a flowchart of the operations you’d want to run on that input. The input enters at one end, travels through this system of various processes, and emerges as output at the other. The tensor goes in, runs through a set of operations, and then comes out the other side, which is why it’s called TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Tensorflow Components?\n",
    "**Tensor**\n",
    "Tensorflow gets its name from its underlying framework, Tensor. Tensors are used in every computation of Tensorflow. A tensor is an n-dimensional vector or matrix that may represent any form of data. A tensor’s values all have the same data type with a known (or partially known) form. The dimensionality of the matrix or array determines the form of the data. A tensor might come from either the input data or the output of a calculation. All operations in TensorFlow are carried out within a graph. The graph is a series of computations that happen in order. Each operation is referred to as an op node, and they are all linked together. The graph depicts the operations and relationships that exist between the nodes. It does not, however, show the values. The tensor, or a means to supply the operation with data, is the edge of the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graphs**\n",
    "A graph framework is used by TensorFlow. The graph collects and summarizes all of the training’s series calculations. The graph offers a number of benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It was designed to work on many CPUs or GPUs, as well as on mobile devices.\n",
    "2. The graph’s portability enables the computations to be saved for immediate or later usage. The graph can be saved and run at a later time.\n",
    "3. The graph’s calculations are all done by linking tensors together.\n",
    "4. There is a node and an edge in a tensor. The mathematical process is carried out by the node, which results in endpoint outputs. The node input/output connections are explained by the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do so many people like Tensorflow?\n",
    "TensorFlow is designed to be user-friendly. The Tensorflow library includes a variety of APIs for creating large-scale deep learning architectures such as CNNs and RNNs. TensorFlow is a graph-based programming language that allows developers to view the neural network’s creation using Tensorboad. This software debugging tool is really useful. Finally, Tensorflow is designed to be used in large-scale deployments. It runs on both the CPU and the GPU."
