# Deep Learning with TensorFlow: <br> Tutorials for modeling in the Amazon


[**Development Seed**](https://developmentseed.org/)

<!-- #endregion -->

These materials are designed to provide TensorFlow expertise via tutorials and science support, vis a vis suggestions for training, testing, and evaluation of TensorFlow models as well as different deep learning techniques demoed in Colab notebooks using real data.

```{admonition} How to run the notebook code
:class: important

A major advantage of executable books is that the reader may enjoy running the source code, modifying them and playing around. No downloading, installation or configuration are required. Simply go to 

[https://developmentseed.github.io/servir-amazonia-ml/docs/index.html](https://developmentseed.github.io/servir-amazonia-ml/docs/index.html),

and in the left menu select any topic, click the "rocket" icon at the top right of the screen, and choose â€œColab." This will launch the page in a virtual runtime environment hosted by Google. From there, the code can be run using a free GPU.

For local running, the code for each topic in the form of 
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks can be downloaded by clicking the "arrow-down" icon at the top right of the screen.

```{admonition} How to access the data
:class: important

Ideally, all data would be ingested from a storage bucket on Google Cloud Platform, however, input/output to Google Colab from cloud storage is prohibitively slow and fragile. For the purpose of this workshop, we have shared a Google Drive folder with participants. To use its contents during the workshop, please right click on the folder from Google Drive and select `Add shortcut to Drive` and select your `My Drive` folder as the destination. This will allow you to programmatically read the data via a path that mimics your personal drive rather than your shared drive.
