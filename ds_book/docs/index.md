```{admonition} How to run the notebook code
:class: important

A major advantage of executable books is that the reader may enjoy running the source code, modifying them and playing around. No downloading, installation or configuration are required. Simply go to 

[https://github.com/developmentseed/servir-amazonia-ml/docs/index.html](https://github.com/developmentseed/servir-amazonia-ml/docs/index.html),

in the left menu select any chapter below the Introduction, click the "rocket" icon at the top right of the screen, and choose â€œBinder". After some initialization time (for the first time it is rather long) the notebook can be run.

For local running, the codes for each chapter in the form of 
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks can be downloaded by clicking the "arrow-down" icon at the top right of the screen. A complete set of files is also available from the links given above.

Appendix {ref}`app-run` explains step-by-step how to proceed with the local execution of the codes.
