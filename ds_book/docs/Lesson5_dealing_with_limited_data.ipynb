While rivers have relatively clear cut boundaries, flooded zones in the center of the image are more complex, with many dfferent land cover types mixed together in a close setting.

However, if we find with our models that a class of interest is confused with a rare class that we don't care about, it might be worth annotating this class in order to more holistically test our model's performance\n",
    "    - if we are primarily interested in mapping flooded forest, we might prioritize mapping flooded forest zones as a whole (ignoring microscale differences in cover, such as areas with slightly more canopy). It may also be a good idea to annotate rivers since this class could be easily confused with flooded areas.\n",
    "* how specific should these classes be? \n",
    "    - there's always an ideal set of classes we wish we could map and what is possible with the data available\n",
    "    - some classes we wish to separate may be too spectrally similar with the data available to us\n",
    "    - a good example of this in the image above might be two different species of mangroves. With Landsat, Sentinel-2, or Planet imagery, we would not be able to map species level differences in naturally occurring mangrove trees.\n",
    "* phrased another way, is there a spectral or textural signal in the satellite imagery that annotators see when annotating?\n",
    "    - if there's no signal, we either need to get the data or refine the classes to make them more general\n",
    "    - if the spectral signal used for annotation is in a time series, labels need to be made with timestamps and the modeling approach needs to be able to incorporate time series data\n",
    "    - if there is a textural signal used in the modeling approach, the groundtruth data needs to be accurately georeferenced as polygons. CNN based models use textural methods.\n"

Some deep learning models, such as Mask R-CNN, train a model end-to-end to take raster inputs and return instance segmentation outputs (which can be thought of as vectors or polygon coordinates).
