    "These materials are designed to provide TensorFlow expertise via tutorials and science support to the SERVIR-Amazonia Hub and key stakeholders on two modeling efforts: 1) TerraBio (Monitoring Forest Dynamics from Space to Enable Sustainable Livelihoods and Biodiversity Conservation in the Amazon) and 2) Monitoring of Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon. The end goal of the project will be to advance the implementation and delivery of key SERVIR-Amazonia services that rely on neural networks written in TensorFlow by improving hub capacities. These improvements will address training, testing, and evaluation of TF models as well as different ML techniques demoed in Colab notebooks using real data. "

    "Inspiration for computational mathematical models discussed in this course originates from the biological structure of our neural system {cite}`kandel2012principles`. The central nervous system (the brain) contains a huge number ($\\sim 10^{11}$) of [neurons](https://human-memory.net/brain-neurons-synapses/), which may be viewed as tiny elementary processor units. They receive a signal via **dendrites**, and in case it is strong enough, the nucleus decides (a computation done here!) to \"fire\" an output signal along the **axon**, where it is subsequently passed via axon terminals to dendrites of other neurons. The axon-dendrite connections (the **synaptic** connections) may be weak or strong, modifying the passed stimulus. Moreover, the strength of the synaptic connections may change in time ([Hebbian rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory) tells us that the connections get stronger if they are being used repeatedly). In this sense, the neuron is \"programmable\". \n"

    "We may ask ourselves if the number of neurons in the brain should really be termed so \"huge\" as usually claimed. Let us compare it to the computing devices with memory chips. The number of $10^{11}$ neurons roughly corresponds to the number of transistors in a 10GB memory chip, which does not impress us so much, as these days we may buy such a device for 2\\$ or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the speed of traveling of the nerve impulses, which is due to electrochemical processes, is not impressive, either. Fastest signals, such as those related to muscle positioning, travel at speeds up to 120m/s (the myelin sheaths are essential to achieve them). The touch signals reach about 80m/s, whereas pain is transmitted only at comparatively very slow speeds of 0.6m/s. This is the reason why when you drop a hammer on your toe, you sense it immediately, but the pain reaches your brain with a delay of ~1s, as it has to pass the distance of ~1.5m. On the other hand, in electronic devices the signal travels along the wires at speeds of the order of the speed of light, $\\sim 300000{\\rm km/s}=3\\times 10^{8}{\\rm m/s}$!\n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, the average [reaction time](https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/reactiontime) is 0.25s to a visual stimulus, 0.17s to an audio stimulus, and 0.15s to a touch. Thus setting the threshold time for a false start in sprints at 0.1s is safely below a possible reaction of a runner. These are extremely slow reactions compared to electronic responses. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the energy consumption of the brain, one can estimate that on the average a cortical neuron [fires](https://aiimpacts.org/rate-of-neuron-firing/) about once per 6 seconds. Likewise, it is unlikely that an average cortical neuron fires more than once per second. Multiplying the firing rate by the number of all the cortical neurons, $\\sim 1.6 \\times 10^{10}$, yields about $3 \\times 10^{9}$ firings/s in the cortex, or 3GHz. This is the rate of a typical processor chip! Hence if the firing is identified with an elementary calculation, the thus defined power of the brain is comparable to that of a standard computer processor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above facts might indicate that, from a point of view of naive comparisons with silicon-based chips, the human brain is nothing so special. So what is it that gives us our unique abilities: amazing visual and audio pattern recognition, thinking, consciousness, intuition, imagination? The answer is linked to an amazing architecture of the brain, where each neuron (processor unit) is connected via synapses to, on the average, 10000 (!) other neurons. This feature makes it radically different and immensely more complicated than the architecture consisting of a control unit, processor, and memory in our computers (the [von Neumann machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) architecture). There, the number of connections is of the order of the number of bits of the memory. In contrast, there are about $10^{15}$ synaptic connections in the human brain. As mentioned, the connections may be \"programmed\" to get stronger or weaker. If, for the sake of a simple estimate, we approximated the connection strength by just two states of a synapse, 0 or 1, the total number of combinatorial configurations of such a system would be $2^{10^{15}}$ - a humongous number. Most of such configuration, of course, never realize in practice, nevertheless the number of possible configuration states of the brain, or the \"programs\" it can run, is truly immense."

The complexity of the network and the tasks it may accomplish increase, naturally, with the number of layers and the number of neurons. \n",

In multi-layer (more than one neuron layer) networks the neuron layers preceding the output layer (purple blobs) are called **intermediate layers**. If the number of layers is large (e.g. as many as 64, 128, ...), we deal with the recent \"ground-breaking\" **deep networks**.\n",

    "\n",
    "The signal from the input travels along the links (edges, synaptic connections), indicated with arrows, to the neurons in subsequent layers. In feed-forward networks, as the one in {numref}`ffnn-fig`, it can only move forward (from left to right in the figure): from the input to the first neuron layer, from the first to the second, and so on until the output is reached. No going backward to preceding layers, or parallel propagation among the neurons of the same layer, are allowed. This would be a **recurrent** feature that we touch upon in section {ref}`lat-lab`. \n",
