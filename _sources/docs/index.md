# Deep Learning with TensorFlow: <br> Tutorials for modeling in the Amazon


[**Development Seed**](https://developmentseed.org/)

<!-- #endregion -->

These materials are designed to provide TensorFlow expertise via tutorials and science support to the SERVIR-Amazonia Hub and key stakeholders on two modeling efforts: 1) TerraBio (Monitoring Forest Dynamics from Space to Enable Sustainable Livelihoods and Biodiversity Conservation in the Amazon) and 2) Monitoring of Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon. The end goal of the project will be to advance the implementation and delivery of key SERVIR-Amazonia services that rely on neural networks written in TensorFlow by improving hub capacities. These improvements will address training, testing, and evaluation of TF models as well as different ML techniques demoed in Colab notebooks using real data.

```{admonition} How to run the notebook code
:class: important

A major advantage of executable books is that the reader may enjoy running the source code, modifying them and playing around. No downloading, installation or configuration are required. Simply go to 

[https://github.com/developmentseed/servir-amazonia-ml/tree/jupyterbook/docs/index.html](hhttps://github.com/developmentseed/servir-amazonia-ml/tree/jupyterbook/docs/index.html),

in the left menu select any chapter below the Introduction, click the "rocket" icon at the top right of the screen, and choose â€œBinder". After some initialization time (for the first time it is rather long) the notebook can be run.

For local running, the codes for each chapter in the form of 
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks can be downloaded by clicking the "arrow-down" icon at the top right of the screen. A complete set of files is also available from the links given above.

Appendix {ref}`app-run` explains step-by-step how to proceed with the local execution of the codes.
